# w0rd.it
URL shorteners are great.. but their hashes are hard to memorize (especially as the use alphanumeric hashes). 

A real bummer if you need to remember a long URL.

[w0rd.it](https://w0rd.it) was designed with memorability in mind. Instead of a random hash, you get a word for your URL.

## Notes
* Word credits to [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version) for the words
* Inspired by [what3words](https://what3words.com/)

## Development
The backend is "serverlessly" deployed on Google Firebase. 
The frontend is quickly hacked together in React.
This is a side project of [mine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengro/).

## Deployment
To deploy everything to firebase run:
```
./deploy
```
