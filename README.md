# A word-based URL shortener

Is there a long URL you need to access right here and now? URL shorteners are great, but they give you a short but hard-to-memorize hash.
Never again that shall happen to you. Here is [w0rd.it](https://w0rd.it). Instead of a random hash, you get a memorable word for your URL.

The words come from [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version).

## Development 

The backend is "serverlessly" deployed on Google Firebase. The frontend is written in React.

## Deployment
To deploy everything run:
```
./deploy
```
