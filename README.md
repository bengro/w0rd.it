# w0rd.it
Remember a long URL on the spot! 

URL shorteners are great, but their hashes are hard-to-memorize. A real bummer if you want to remember it and you have a poor short-term memory like me.
That shall not happen to you anymore. 

Here is [w0rd.it](https://w0rd.it). Instead of a random hash, you get a memorable word for your URL.

## Notes
* Credits to [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version) for the words.
* Inspired by [what3words](https://what3words.com/).

## Development 
The backend is "serverlessly" deployed on Google Firebase. The frontend is quickly hacked together in React. This is a side project.

## Deployment
To deploy everything to firebase run:
```
./deploy
```
